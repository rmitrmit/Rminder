    <h1>Group 12: Our IT Project</h1>

    <hr>

    <h2>Team Profile</h2>
    
      <p>We - Lê Đức Trung, Trương Gia Lợi, Hồ Lê Anh Minh, and Đỗ Văn Tùng - are “100”. 100 stands for the number 4 in bits, and can be seen as the symbol of apex, total commitment, and wholeness.</p>
      
      <p>Our first member, Lê Đức Trung (s3979718), is a tech oddball. Originally from the humanities, he did not invest most of his previous years in information technology like many of his peers did, but was nonetheless hooked by its magic. As he discovered more about computers, he realized that he has a fondness for software's user interface and experience, as he recall growing up always comparing which operating system looked better and enjoying beautifully designed web/mobile applications. Moreover, a natural organizer, he seeks to acquire and develop skills concerning managing fascinating and large tech projects. This is his plan: He dissects the problem, comes up with a general blueprint for the solutions, assigns tasks, comes up with deadlines and schedules, and ensures a smooth execution and collaboration from all members from start to finish. Outside of school, he reads early modern Russian literature and toys with whatever he is building - maybe an app or a Minecraft redstone construction.</p>
      
      <p>Our second member, Trương Gia Lợi (s3924514) is also a computer novice. Diving in the terra cognita of Information Technology, albeit pulled in many directions in the current initial discovery phases, he has kindled in himself a love for cybersecurity. When not studying, he is a sport (both traditional and esports) aficionado, and is the life of the party. The latter trademark granted  him the occasion to mess with digital audio mixers in rave events, which sparked an intense love for the seamless operations of bits and mechanics. This trademark has also made him an asset to our team, as he can gather valuable resources that can only be socially attained (e.g. sample documentations from other students) à l'aise. Lợi, therefore, is entrusted with the overall social aspects of our team, such as identifying, assigning, and signposting crucial roles stemming from the requirements of the project.</p>
    
      <p>Our third member, Hồ Lê Anh Minh (s4027621) is the most seasoned tech geek in our team in terms of theoretical and practical expertise in databases and programming. He has passed his high school years solving problems in Pascal before studying computer science at two different universities for over a semester where he familiarized himself with Java, NoSQL, APIs implementations, etc. Coming back to RMIT Vietnam, he wishes to educate himself in machine learning and artificial intelligence. With such experience and aspirations, it is natural for us to assign him overlooking highly technical aspects of the project such as which frameworks to build upon and the nitty-gritty of the development process. Outside of school, he has other personal tech projects to work on (e.g. building a stock-market website) and, for the sake of enjoyment, plays sports.</p>
      
      <p>Our fourth member, Đỗ Văn Tùng (s4053400) shares the interest in artificial intelligence with Minh, though it leans more towards natural language processing rather than coming up with models for different purposes. He also somewhat shares the background of liberal arts education like Trung, having spent a year in America briefly touching upon different subjects such as music and literature. The tipping point was when he used ChatGPT to build his own website that manages audio clips and music production resources, as he realized how powerful the technology is and its possible influences. This sets him out as a fast learner, a creative, who can otherwise be regarded as, to be tongue-in-cheek, the “dreamer” of the group. He can generate a host of diverse ideas in no time, chief among which has lent itself to our team's final goals, and, therefore, plays the part of defining the whats and hows for all members to follow.</p>
      
      <p>To sum up, our team “100” consists of unique individuals, each with his own strengths and a shared élan of perfecting what we deem as invaluable to the community. And what that is, presented here, is Rminder - a highly integrated productivity software that replaces traditional workstation and other productive tools on the market.</p>

    <h2>Tools</h2>

      <p>You can find an online version of our report here:</p>

      <p>To develop and manage the page collaboratively, we have created the following GitHub repository:</p>

      <p>Looking back at our web building stages, we have a few points to comment on. Firstly, since we are new to using Git and GitHub and due to the simple nature of our web page, our audit trail does not contain too many adjustments, let alone complex merging of different branches. Secondly, to extend our knowledge and skills on HTML (as well as CSS and JavaScript), we learn from and our code on prototype pages from a low-code development environment called “Webflow”, where the elements are abundant and properly organized. This aids in helping us understand the best practices of web development. Thirdly, we played by our strengths when building the page. For example, Tùng, more familiar with GitHub than us from the outset, has initiated the repository where he had done some prototyping for our intended product, while Trung made much contributions on the layout and overall look of our page.</p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>All students face the problems of organizing and committing to their studying, especially in such a period where processes required for learning, attending classes, taking exams, etc. are becoming more and more digitized and complex. There is a Team link for class meetings, hidden in one's friend group's chat box or conversations with one's lecturer; Lesson files are dispersed (and incomplete) on your local machine and nowhere to be found on the learning platform. These, frustrating the students, hampering efficient studying, demotivating them in the long run, and stopping them from their potential already, are only the tip of the “workflow” iceberg.</p>

        <p>Since we are one of those students, who strive to do our best in class but are blocked by these conveniences, we wish to change the game. We want every student to wake up energized and excited to believe that today's learning is going to go well, to know that they have a genie on their side who will assist them with every tedious detail of cleaning up the pipeline of academic endeavors: all the scheduling, recalling which classes to take, or when and where to head to what - we want them gone.</p>

        <p>What will this help look like, packed as it is into one single product? Though the functionality of a deliverable may scale infinitely, the mainframe should include: (1) integration and automation of multiple platforms used by students and their institutions, (2) tailored reminders for all types of activity, and (3) automated intuitive organization of academic and digital resources.</p>

        <p>For our first function, we automate for our users tasks that they have to do frequently, like sending a weekly reminder to their team on important deadlines. We get rid of tedious intermediary steps of opening, closing software, and remembering information in-between actions to accomplish the tasks: no more opening a calendar app to manually add a section, remember another, and firing the email app, looking for receivers, and drafting content, etc. Chains of triggers that link different applications together can save the users time previously spent on much mindless toying and energy previously invested in non-crucial work.</p>

        <p>The second function allows our users to receive emails, notifications, or even phone calls that inform them on the next step of their day. Although this may require some little setting up, our application can learn the patterns of receptions and repeat them in the future or ask for its self-adjustment from time to time. This function, based on the logics of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), has the same root as the third.</p>

        <p>Our third function allows our users to step away from the task of organizing files and folders, which can be time-consuming, ineffective, and downright tedious. Based on the acquired insights from our users, we can create a workspace architecture that is clean and intuitive for them to easily access at any time.</p>

        <p>Our distinct values are twofold: the focus on students and the incorporation of ML and AI. Though popular integrated and automated workspaces such as Zapier and ClickUp are widely used in corporate environments, they may be challenging to learn for students, as they require familiarization with a diverse range of other productivity software. Moreover, these workspaces can potentially conflict with ones chosen for a particular institution or in idiosyncratic circumstances, which may be due to the lack of a unified one-for-all solution in academic settings. For example, a student may have to use both Zoom and Microsoft Teams, Outlook and Gmail, or Zalo and Canvas, all at the same time, due to different requirements of the lecturers. This can trickle into the incompatibility of those workspaces and applications used, which becomes counterproductive at the end of the day. Our product, therefore, strives to solve these problems for students. Moreover, the workspaces have not yet launched the functionality of automated files and folders organization fueled by AI and ML, which renders our product more useful in terms of functionality.</p>

        <p>If we were to work on this project, we would be launchers of one amongst a sea of productivity applications used by all types of users, but still one shining gem in technologies utilized by academics specifically. Following the surge of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence recently, we want to incorporate the functions mentioned above into our product as the unique selling point. In the eyes of recruiters, we would be problems scourgers and action-takers, which are roles required to aid the functioning of any systems in any specializations. Different as we are regarding our backgrounds and goals, and nonetheless collaborating seamlessly, we will not only come up as the dream team collectively, but also decent group players individually, who get the balance of 'forcibly influencing' and 'being swayed' optimal. In short, we have practiced to be good meta-players in a meta-team.</p>

      <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
        <h4>Aims</h4>
          <p>Our aim is to develop software to help students learn at their own convenience and in their own way. Mr. Long once said that the advent of the internet made information more widely available, while the coming advent of AI - which we are currently seeing - will filter and personalize the vast sea of information that’s available on the internet and around us to further help us gain relevant knowledge and increase productivity. We could utilize current AI technologies to analyze and deeply understand each student’s learning ability, as well as their aspirations and goals, and guide them through their academic journey with the endless library of data from the Internet, and intelligence of an AI system.</p>

        <h4>Plans and Progress</h4>
          <p>We have designed a prototype that incorporated these following elements:</p>
          <p>1. Database Implementation: We established a simple yet effective database using Firebase. This database stores crucial information related to lectures, such as date, time, meeting links, and lecture slides. This information is organized and grouped into notifications, making it easier to manage.</p>
          <p>2. Front-End Development: Our front-end interface, constructed using HTML and JavaScript, plays a pivotal role in streamlining the user experience. It presents notifications in an organized manner, resembling discrete "blocks." Each block encapsulates the essential details of a lecture.</p>
          <p>3. Simplified Email Automation: Within the interface, we introduced a user-friendly feature—a button. When clicked, this button initiates the creation of precomposed emails. These emails are meticulously structured with the correct information and recipients, significantly reducing the user's manual effort. All that remains is to send these emails, ensuring timely communication and access to essential lecture materials.</p>
          <p>Through the integration of database management, front-end design, and email automation, we are poised to streamline the educational experience and reduce the friction associated with online learning. This marks a significant stride toward our broader vision of utilizing AI to personalize and optimize the learning journey for all Students.</p>
          <p>For future developments, we will adopt Scrum methodology [1]. The methodology requires the following roles: product owner – who sets the vision for what the final product looks like and how to achieve that vision; scrum master – who thoroughly trains other members on Scrum agile workflow and ensures that Scrum agile principles are met throughout all stages; and developers – who contribute directly to the concretization of the product, to collaborate in a transparent and flexible manner in sprints (processes of achieving some defined goals). The methodology also calls for backbone objects such as the product backlog (specifications of use cases and scopes) and the sprint backlog (plans for development stages) upon which the collaborative efforts are based. </p>

        <h4>Roles</h4>
          <p>Lê Đức Trung takes on the position of managing both the project and application development, is the person who will assign tasks to all remaining members, and will remind the reporting time so that everyone can keep it on the right track that is scheduled when the initial decision is made. Moreover, He is also the one who will collect all the team reports and edit them to add to the final summary report.</p>
          <p>Trương Gia Lợi is our scrum master and the one who assigns roles to team members. Loi and Trung will also represent the user's point of view, they will review and give opinions to be able to fix errors and develop more projects. He will also be the one to find potential users to let them try the product and draw the final fixes.</p>
          <p>Hồ Lê Anh Minh as the main application developer of the team, will take care of most of the technical tasks of the team. Having prior knowledge of the IT industry is his advantage, he can easily handle technical difficulties. Moreover, his relationship with industry professionals has also helped us a lot in developing the project and gathering opinions from the experts.</p>
          <p>Đỗ Văn Tùng is the owner of the project and this is also the person who came up with this product idea for our whole team, so he is the one who will be in charge of setting up the main functions for our product and will be the one to collect members' personal opinions about this product so that we can continue to improve the product.</p>

        <h4>Scope and Limits</h4>
          <p>Our project’s scope is to provide and support a method that can enhance productivity and reduce the time not only for students but also for lecturers and educational institutions. Below are the main functions that our product will conduct:</p>
          <p>1. Integration and automation: As our primary purpose of this project, our production will combine and suggest ever single tools and apps that students and lecturers are required to have for different classes. As a result, it will create a common and friendly environment that will optimize the workflows and reduce the manual actions.</p>
          <p>2. Tailored reminder: As there are different kinds of events and actions in education environments, our product will support lecturers, students and schools to custom and access to diverse communication gates and time management tools. Consequently, not only lecturers can remind and notify their students, but also students can manage their own groups’ timeframe and divide tasks in group projects.</p>
          <p>3. Automation in organizing files and folders: Rminder acts as a repository for files needed for school and work, just like Google Drive and OneDrive. What makes the repository of Rminder superior compared to other cloud workspaces is the ability to automatically arrange these files and folders based on the preferences of the end-users using AI.</p>
          <p>Although there are many convenient features in this product, nothing is escape from limitation. It is important to be aware of several restrictions and factors that could have an impact on using experience of this product:</p>
          <p>1. User Behavior: It requires time for users to use this software proficiently. As there are many customizable functions, the user needs to learn how to adjust and manage automation tasks. As a result, instruction such as video or training courses should be conducted before using the software.</p>
          <p>2. Information Dependency: As we need a tremendous amount of information from users, accessing users' information such as Gmail, timetable, personal information etc. is an ultimate requirement. Consequently, we can easily receive notifications and work proficiently.</p>
          <p>3. AI learning: To enhance AI features, it needs a certain amount of time to help the AI detect user behaviors so that we need as much user behavior as possible to develop AI features.</p>
          <p>4. Privacy and Security: Due to the deep access to personal information and data, it increases the concern about privacy and security. Consequently, Ensuring about the protection of data is the most essential part that we focus on.</p>

        <h4>Testing</h4>
          <p>We've been putting our product to the test in three classes where we had access to the email lists. Our experience has been mixed so far. Some students have given positive feedback, appreciating the email reminders. However, we haven't received extensive feedback from the majority of students.</p>
          <p>At this stage, our project is still in the prototype phase. We designed these emails to serve as subtle reminders for those who might find them beneficial. Hence, it's not surprising that we haven't received an overwhelming response from students.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, as we move into the next phase with enhanced automation, we plan to formally propose to RMIT faculties the idea of incorporating our system into their classes. In the project's early stages, we attempted to secure teachers' permission to send email reminders to their students, but unfortunately, our requests were declined across the board.  The criteria are as following:</p>

          <p>However, due to the agile nature of the Scrum methodology, our team may have to make many amendments on the fly, both operationally and in terms of the final vision. Therefore, this plan should serve as a rough guide which serves a certain amount of predictability that is necessary for the smooth functioning of the whole team, at least at the present stage.</p>

          <p style="color:black;">Even though our final product performs well in terms of features, we still cannot avoid facing difficulties at the beginning when we first apply the product to the system. First and foremost, the trust of users will be something that we have to face, our product is so new that it will not be easy to gain the trust of users in the early days. At the same time to be able to apply our product and an educational system, we need a lot of cooperation from the teacher to the students. Since this is a new system, we need to guide the teachers and students about the operations and functions of the application. This application is considered to completely change the learning and teaching habits of the school. Before applying the product, teachers only need to upload learning files to the class's social network group and students need to access many data sources to be able to search for knowledge. Furthermore, our product will cause teachers to do more work than the old way of teaching, they will have to upload at the right time and on the right topic of that knowledge, but this gives an advantage to the teachers. However, students only need to have the right access to our website to get the necessary knowledge, no need to wander around like before.</p>

          <ol style="color:black;">
          <li>A designer will be the position that we target first, they will be the ones to help me develop the interface of the system because this is not our strong point, a system with a good-looking interface will create the first impression on the user and will be able to subconsciously motivate them to use that product. Design and sketching are specialized skills that our team can hardly learn quickly to make the system more beautiful, so an investment in this position will be a necessary decision. At the same time, they will have experience in how to make something as dry as our system eye-catching, a beautiful interface will be one of the main factors to make a project successful.</li>
          <li>A professional programmer is the next target for our project development, because most of the members are new in this field, and there will be unforeseen errors that will happen, a experienced programmer's process will help us to overcome this difficulty. They will be proficient in being able to quickly create the functions that the product needs, which will save a lot of time for the realization of our product. At the same time, compared to us, they will be quicker in detecting errors and easily fix them.</li>
          <li>The project will need an additional person who can survey universities and educational systems in the country to invite them to use our system, that person will have a lot of knowledge about the system and be able to good communication skills to be able to convince schools to adopt our product and their system. Moreover, they are also our representatives to carry out transactions with partners, so this position needs someone who can be trusted and has high expertise.</li>
          <li>A Data Analyst and Performance Measurement Specialist is someone who helps us track information related to the number of visits and the amount of knowledge downloaded, and is the person who analyzes data for the entire product to contribute ideas to the technical team. can develop the project thoroughly. They are also the ones who closely monitor the data on our behalf, this is a process that takes a lot of time and requires meticulousness from computer technicians.</li>

    <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Finishing the assignment and working on our project, we as a group are grateful for each member’s contribution and the learning that comes along, and are humbled by the improvements we could have made.</p>
        <p>The ambience of our group from the first to the last project has been well balanced – we were not entirely peaceful in the sense that everybody agreed to each other without exception, but were rather respectful of differences and striving to find a common voice and solving any arising problems. For example, when we were coming up with the idea for the project and its prototype, Tùng raised the intention of asking for a change in the assignment’s structure so we can focus more on building, and not writing.</p>
        <p>What also went well was the scheduling. Trung did a great job of making sure everyone grasped what they needed to do and the quality of our product. He created an open spreadsheet where everyone can refer to for updates on our group’s progress, the deadlines, and important notes.</p>
        <img src="Screenshot 2023-09-16 115531.png">
        <p>It was surprising to find how much resources each individual member could contribute to our group. For example, the connections that Minh had with IT professionals outside of school has helped us streamline lots of work, the access to and the familiarity with AI that Tùng had has made brainstorming, writing, and prototyping so much more efficient, and the closeness with other school fellows that Lợi possessed had acquired good quality samples for references. In other words, we played by our strengths and got each other’s back in unexpected ways.</p>
        <p>The improvement that we could have implemented is dealing with time. In retrospect, many of our tasks, especially writing, could have been easily finished in a much shorter amount of time if we were to carve out a day for it. This could have saved us much more time to further perfect our deliverable and for cool projects outside of school, which would be tremendously valuable in the long run. We could have also focused more on the technical aspects of the project, as that might spark more creativity and strengthen our collaboration. For example, Trung could have spent more time learning UI/UX design and Lợi could have practiced more JavaScript to actually have more to add more functionalities to our assignment or to broaden the team’s project bucket list.</p>
        <p>Still, overall, our team did a good job. Each member showed to others exemplary methods of getting our tasks done, and had learned a great deal in terms of practices and the work ethos. Such a great start promises a fruitful future collaboration and meaningful contribution to the tech industry.</p>

        <p>Trung: I have discovered how personalities of our group shape and foster our workflow, which is surprising. For example, Tùng, more of a dreamer, would not be concerned about all the details of our assignment but more of what role it may play in the long run for all members, while I, more dutiful, pick up the position of an organizer very naturally and assign tasks for everyone. For me, this observation may aid me in planning my career, as such an observed temperament will serve me well in managerial positions. I have also learned how the group functions smoothly when all members are on board and understand thoroughly the common goals, which must be concrete and measurable. When everyone knows what part they play and the criteria for being a successful player, fear of uncertainty and related stress are gone, enabling us to perform at our best. Moreover, I find it extremely helpful to not micromanage a group where all members are somewhat creative, because scrutiny can hamper the limitless productivity of their creative spirits and hamper my own learning – which must be outsourced to what my team members bring to the table. Finally, I have also practiced negotiating the end-goal of a collective work, which is to find the balance between different worldviews, priorities, and the circumstantial constraints.</p>
        <p>Lợi: All process of our assignment is on track, everything was good, from divided sessions for each member to our relationship, all things worked together very well. First and foremost, I had more friendly and trusting relationships, everyone was outgoing although I was the youngest person, and they were so open to answering my questions when I struggled with this information about our assignment. On the other hand, I widened my knowledge about the IT industry through this assignment, it also brought me a new perspective about how the world runs. For instance, when we create an application or run a business, we must be concerned about the risks that can come to our project, and what difficulties can affect our process. In the beginning of this assignment, I thought it would take a lot of time to finish the project, but when we sat together and divided the session for everyone, everything was finished a lot faster than I expected. Finally, I knew how to use many effective tools that can help me optimize the potential of our application, to cite a prime example, Chat GPT, is a tool that helped me a lot to research information and also put many ideas into my head to do this assignment.</p>
        <p>Minh: After this class, especially my group, I have learned a lot about organizing a group and scheduling the timetable for the deadlines and group timetable which is the most important knowledge and skill in both working and studying environment. Thanks to Trung, he showed me how to use Asana which is an app that helps all teammates catch up the schedule of the assignment and remind us of upcoming deadlines. Besides, the most surprising part of this project is the great performance in making websites and using Git of Tung. During the time of building the website, Tung taught me a lot in using HTML and JavaScript which will be the most necessary language for my future career. Moreover, I also recognize that giving a chance to every teammate to contribute their own ideas and opinions is an essential part to make the project as creative as possible. As a result, if the first idea has problems as it is too hard to accomplish, we instantly will have another idea as a backup plan. Finally, there are still features that I still want to develop more for our product. However, due to the limit of time, we have to stop at a few features but thanks to this project, I have gained a lot of new knowledge and skill so that I can make a better product in the future.</p>
        <p>Tùng: I want to thank Trung for relentlessly pushing the group to achieve goals by a deadline and being the sole director of the group. Thanks to him, we were all on top of our tasks. A lot of things went well because we were organized. It allowed us to allocate time to quickly build and test a product, which made it easier to evaluate and see the weaknesses in our idea - we saw a few. Being well-organized also helped us communicate more effectively, since we were always clear on each member’s responsibility. I also recognized areas where we have improved. We could have spent more time doubling down on our product development and have a more advanced prototype. We could have also devised a collective effort to focus on approaching faculties and asking for permission to let us operate our product in many more classes. I was particularly surprised by the smooth sailing we enjoyed when we maintained our organization compared to past experiences in group work, where fragmented efforts often hindered commitment. I’ve noticed that it’s hard to get everyone committed when we don't establish a connection from the start. Working with the group also taught me the importance of first impressions. The initial impression sets the foundation for a member's sense of responsibility within a group, and over time, this sense builds upon itself. It's a powerful motivator to maintain that positive impression, because most of us would hate to betray a good first impression. Finally, I was fortunate on the day we formed teams, because I decided to open myself up, and was able to connect with the right people.</p>
