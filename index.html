    <p style="color:white;">Even though our final product performs well in terms of features, we still cannot avoid facing difficulties at the beginning when we first apply the product to the system. First and foremost, the trust of users will be something that we have to face, our product is so new that it will not be easy to gain the trust of users in the early days. At the same time to be able to apply our product and an educational system, we need a lot of cooperation from the teacher to the students. Since this is a new system, we need to guide the teachers and students about the operations and functions of the application. This application is considered to completely change the learning and teaching habits of the school. Before applying the product, teachers only need to upload learning files to the class's social network group and students need to access many data sources to be able to search for knowledge. Furthermore, our product will cause teachers to do more work than the old way of teaching, they will have to upload at the right time and on the right topic of that knowledge, but this gives an advantage to the teachers. However, students only need to have the right access to our website to get the necessary knowledge, no need to wander around like before.</p>
